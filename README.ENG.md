The application supports two languages: English and Russian. You can set multiple timers at the same time. After you press the "Add" button, the timer will start counting. You can put any timer on pause.

The timer names cannot be the same, and the time in seconds starts at 0 or exceeds 3122064000. When the time expires, the timer is removed from the list.
